# Hi there! 👋

I'm an algorithm engineer passionate about Bayesian information processing and machine learning. I'm also an avid coder and software design enthusiast.

🏢 I created [InspireCraft][inspire_craft], a platform where a group of like-minded peers come together to code fun tech projects, fostering a culture of hands-on learning through practical experience.
